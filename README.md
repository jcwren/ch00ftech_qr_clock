These are the source files for the ch00ftech QR clock. I put them on GitHub
since they're somewhat hard to find on the web site. Included are links to the
original pages where they came from.

Twitter feed.

v1.1 is the original QR clock in kit form. v2.2 was the production clock
that was available on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/ch00ftech/)
